    <h1>My Favourite Hobby- Reading</h1>
    <p>I have loved to read since I was a child. It is my favourite pastime and has played a big role in improving my English skills. 
    Reading has taught me some great life lessons, sparked my imagination, and helped me explore new ideas and perspectives. 
    Some of my favourite ficitional books include <strong>The Book Thief</strong> by Markus Zusak, <strong>Kite Runner</strong> by Khaled Hosseini, and <strong>Atomic Habits</strong> in the self help genre. 
    I believe that a good book has the power to change the way you see the world.</p>
